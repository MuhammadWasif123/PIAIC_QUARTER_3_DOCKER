set MCP Server for github in your system
setup claude and gemini in your system for development in this module 	

we will integrate the claude code with gemini so that we can use it free


First setup claude code and then router

create a project in google ai studio and take the gemini key then  set it to the Claude Code Router


basically we need to connect the claude code with gemini and then start with cli on ubuntu 


ccr code ->cli
ccr ui ->ui on local host 


if limit reaches for claude then use Queen Code
